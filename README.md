# Recommended Dev / Debug / Extension Writing Environment (For Newbies)

1. Install WingWare Pro: http://wingware.com/downloads/wing-pro
    Licenses are ~ $100.  This is essentially the best debugging IDE out there for python.
    You could use other IDE's, however, you have to add the source files to the project and set it all up yourself.
    
2. Install python 3.5 or higher, though this was written with 3.6 in mind.

3. Do `where python` at command line to be sure that your PATH variable is set.

4. Do `where pip` similarly and make sure that it points to what you want to use.

5. `pip install pyqt5`

6. Open the .wpr file contained in the source files.  That is the Wing project file.

7. Install TortoiseGit including PuttyGen if neccessary.
    a. Run PuttyGen to generate a public key and before exiting the dialog:
    b. Copy/paste the entire public key text to your GitHub account settings, where you add access keys.
    c. Save the private key to your home folder, or desktop, or somewhere you'll find it later.
    d. Now you can clone this project, and:
    e. You may want to try HTTPS if SSH is not working.  I've found SSH to result in authentication errors.
    f. If you're a complete newbie, TortoiseGit after install is accessed by right-clicking anywhere in a folder explorer.
